# Team Charter

## Instructions

_Answer the questions below and fill out the process sections with your team’s mechanisms to follow your answers. Remove the italicized examples text as you go._

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?** 
 Listen, don't be afraid to put an idea out there, listen and consider ideas before jumping on them. 
  
* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
* If you comfortable to voice your discomfort in the moment, go for it. If you are not comfortable, the morning standup is understood as another venue where anyone is welcome to share
* any situation that may have made them uncomfortable. If someone shares during that standup, it is a neutral space where experiences are validated without being contested. 
* We can then set aside a time (present or later) to address the resolution.
  
  
### Dependability, Structure, Clarity
