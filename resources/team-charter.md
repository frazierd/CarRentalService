# Team Charter

## Instructions

_Answer the questions below and fill out the process sections with your team’s mechanisms to follow your answers. Remove the italicized examples text as you go._

_On real world software teams, you will often create a document like this via a process called [reteaming](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/dynamic-reteaming-how-we-thrive-by-rebuilding-teams/). Having something that captures the goals and concerns of everyone on a team helps the team work more efficiently together._

## Charter

### Team Members

- Kaden Cannon aka Honor
- Frazier Dyson aka goose 
- Muddather Babiker aka hawngry
- Pemberton Heath aka sarge

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?** 
 Listen, don't be afraid to put an idea out there, listen and consider ideas before jumping on them. 
  
* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
* If you comfortable to voice your discomfort in the moment, go for it. If you are not comfortable, the morning standup is understood as another venue where anyone is welcome to share
* any situation that may have made them uncomfortable. If someone shares during that standup, it is a neutral space where experiences are validated without being contested. 
* We can then set aside a time (present or later) to address the resolution.
  
  
### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
* 
* If we are stuck, the culture on our team is to ask questions of each other. Recognize when you have exhausted a couple of available resources, ask your teammates.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
 Do a postmortem as a group to figure out how we miscalculated the approximate time. 
 


* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
* 
 Keep github tasks up to date and communicate regularly with each other as to what we are each doing. 
### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
  _“Apply what we’ve learned throughout this program in a team project to prepare ourselves for internships and full-time SDE roles and to get exposure to front end development.”_


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
  _Positive team culture throughout! MVP functional by the end of the project, enjoy ourselves, maintain our energy to the end, 
ensure all team members participate, create professional connections, 
exceed Jody's expectations, learn and experience the scrum framework in building a project together_


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
  _E.g., develop SDE knowledge, enhance leadership skills, master project planning, improve testing skills, develop front end sills, _


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals, complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  _Daily morning standups with task distribution. We will not pull tickets from no status until all tickets committed to for the sprint are complete. Meet up at 3:40 to chat (morale builder)_
